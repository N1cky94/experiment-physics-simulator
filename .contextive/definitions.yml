contexts:
  - name: Physics
    domainVisionStatement: To represent physics concepts in the software and game engine
    terms:
      - name: Dimension
        definition: The world takes place inside its dimensions or space. This can either be lineair (1D), euclidean (2D), real world (3D).
        examples:
          - A block that can only move in a straight line is in a 1 dimensional space
          - A block that can move in a field is in a 2 dimensional space
          - A block that can move within a sphere is a 3 dimensional space
        aliases:
          - space
      - name: Force
        definition: A mathematical vector that holds direction and intensity to represent a force that can be enacted on objects
        examples:
          - That box is moved by pushing against it with much force
          - Jumping takes a lot of force from the legs
          - Gravity enacts a force on our bodies that roots us to the ground
      - name: Mass
        definition: smth
        examples:
          - smth
      - name: Gravity
        aliases:
          - weight
      - name: Velocity
        aliases:
          - speed
      - name: Acceleration
        aliases:
          - deceleration
          - speeding up
          - speeding
          - slowing down
      - name: Position
        definition: This is where something is located or positioned at the current moment in time.
        aliases:
          - Location
      - name: Time
        definition: Time is the passing of moments that follow in chronological and irreversible order.
  - name: Mathematics
    domainVisionStatement: Used to calculate and describe movements and changes within the physics system
    terms:
      - name: Scalar
        definition: A quantity or phenomenon that exhibits magnitude only, with no specific direction.
        examples:
          - speed
          - mass
          - electrical resistance
      - name: Vector
        definition: A vector is a quantity or phenomenon that has two independent properties, a magnitude and a direction.
        examples:
          - velocity
          - momentum
          - force
          - electromagnetic fields
