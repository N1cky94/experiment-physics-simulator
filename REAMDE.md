# Experiment: Simple Gaming Engine

## Game Engine

The game engine I rebuild with the guidance of Tom's code can be found in the package gameEngine.
This is based on a blog post, that unfortunately has been lost in time.

The `engine` contains the framework to make the games work.
- `gameloop` contains the basic interfaces to work with and the JavaFX implementation we are using to create the game UI
- `physics` contains all the basic interfaces and custom implementations to make physics work in the game engine

## Installing the game
